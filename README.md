This project was made to help those who want to be able to log their workouts and have a plan generated for them but do not have the money to spend on pricey workout apps and websites. I am very passionate about fitness and health and hope this inspires others to also become inspired.
When you run this program, it will ask you for your name which is your login. If it finds that name in the 'profiles' directory, it recognizes that you have already created a file. If not, it will ask you to enter starting weights for an extensive list of workouts. After you have logged in and potentially assigned weights, it will ask you what area you want to work out: upperBody, legs, back, or abs. You simply enter in the area and it produces a set of 3-5 exercises for you. Each exercise is randomly generated (pseudo-random based on the time that you answer questions to produce close to random) from the different groups inside of the major groups. Then based on what information you added when creating a profile or from your last workout, it will assign the reps and weights for each of the exercises. It will then create a workout log or add the workout to your log along with the time. Next, you go workout and do you thing. Then afterwards, you come back and then tell the program how your workout went. If you tell it that your exercise went well, it will randomly (again psuedo-random) increase the difficulty of that workout for next time by increasing the weight, sets, or reps.
